# Status Page Application

A modern status page application built with Next.js and Supabase, allowing organizations to manage their services, track incidents, and communicate status updates to their users.

**Important Note About Admin Roles:**
Administrators (IT admins) are not included as team members in this system. This architectural decision was made because:

Admin roles are specifically designed for IT administrators who manage organizational setup and member access
Team member management is typically a low-frequency activity
Admins don't need real-time notifications about service incidents as they're not part of the operational teams
This separation maintains a clear distinction between system administration and operational responsibilities

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Supabase account

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**

   - Create a new project in Supabase
   - Navigate to Project Settings > API
   - Copy the `anon public` key and project URL

4. **Configure environment variables**

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

5. **Set up the database**

   - Navigate to the SQL editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Execute the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

   ```sql
   -- Organizations
   create table organizations (
       id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
       name text not null,
       slug text unique not null,
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );

   -- Teams
   create table teams (
       id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
       organization_id uuid references organizations(id) on delete cascade not null,
       name text not null,
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );

   -- Team Members
   create table team_members (
       id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),

       name text not null,
       description text,
       current_status text not null check (current_status in ('operational', 'degraded', 'partial_outage', 'major_outage')),
       display_order integer not null default 0,
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
       updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );

       updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
       resolved_at timestamp with time zone
   );

   -- Incident Updates
   create table incident_updates (
       id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
       incident_id uuid references incidents(id) on delete cascade not null,
       message text not null,
       status text not null check (status in ('investigating', 'identified', 'monitoring', 'resolved')),
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );

   -- Incident Services (many-to-many relationship)
   create table incident_services (
       incident_id uuid references incidents(id) on delete cascade not null,
       service_id uuid references services(id) on delete cascade not null,
       primary key (incident_id, service_id)
   );

   -- Maintenance Windows
   create table maintenance (
       id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
       organization_id uuid references organizations(id) on delete cascade not null,
       team_id uuid references teams(id) on delete cascade not null,
       title text not null,
       description text,
       status text not null check (status in ('scheduled', 'in_progress', 'completed')),
       scheduled_start timestamp with time zone not null,
       scheduled_end timestamp with time zone not null,
       created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
       updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );

   -- Maintenance Services (many-to-many relationship)
   create table maintenance_services (
       maintenance_id uuid references maintenance(id) on delete cascade not null,
       service_id uuid references services(id) on delete cascade not null,
       primary key (maintenance_id, service_id)
   );
   ```
